## About

A Github action that deploys a build directory to Netlify. It can be configured to comment on the commit or PR with the deploy URL or deploy with GitHub environments, deploy draft builds, deploy Netlify functions and use custom Netlify configs.

## Getting started

There are 4 required inputs for the action

- `github-token` which is usually `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
- `netlify-auth-token` this is a [personal access token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens) created from your Netlify account
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è This should be stored as a [Github secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in your repo
- `netlify-site-id` this is the API ID of your Netlify site
  - To find this, go to your site's settings and in the "site information" copy the `API ID` field
- `build-dir` this is where your site build outputs to relative to the root of your projects folder

See the [action.yml](./action.yml) for other action inputs and their descriptions

## Usage

Here are some ideas of how to configure this action in different workflows...

- [Deploying drafts on each commit and publishing on push to master](https://github.com/South-Paw/action-netlify-deploy#deploying-drafts-on-each-commit-and-publishing-on-push-to-master)
- [Deploying drafts of pull requests and publishing on push to master](https://github.com/South-Paw/action-netlify-deploy#deploying-drafts-of-pull-requests-and-publishing-on-push-to-master)
- [Deploying drafts of pull requests and publish on release created](https://github.com/South-Paw/action-netlify-deploy#deploying-drafts-of-pull-requests-and-publish-on-release-created)

### Deploying drafts on each commit and publishing on push to master

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  # This job will:
  #   * deploy a draft every time there is a commit that is not on master branch
  #   * comment on that commit with the deploy URL
  deployCommitDraft:
    name: Deploy draft to Netlify
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref != 'refs/heads/master'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      # ... your other build steps to produce a build directory
      # e.g. `npm run build` for create-react-app

      - name: Deploy draft to Netlify
        uses: South-Paw/action-netlify-deploy@v1.0.4

          build-dir: './build'
          draft: true
          comment-on-commit: true

  # This job will:
  #   * deploy a production build every time there is a push only on the master branch
  #   * comment that commit with the deploy URL
  publishMasterCommit:
    name: Publish to Netlify
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
